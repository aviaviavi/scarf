# Using Scarf as system package manager

## Overview

In addition to easy package management, Scarf supports installing
static binaries in a way that sends anonymized usage statistics to the package
author.

## Installation

```bash
$ curl -L https://scarf.sh/install | bash
```

You'll then need to add `~/.scarf/bin` to you `PATH`

## Install your packages

```
$ scarf install <package>
```
