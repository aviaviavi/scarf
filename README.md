The Scarf Package Manager is an experimental prototype of a package manager and ecosystem that supports open-source development by:

- Sharing package usage data with the package maintainers 
- Providing tooling for maintainers' commercial efforts around their open-source work, baked into the distribution layer

We are in the process of a full rewrite of this package manager, equipped with many lessons from this prototype and some exciting new core technology. Follow us for updates and check out [Scarf's other tools for package distribution.](https://about.scarf.sh)
