What is Scarf? Why should I use it? Scarf is a developer-centric, cross-platform system package manager that enables developers to see how their software is actually used and to get paid for their work. If you distribute your software with Scarf, your users will be able to easily install it with the scarf CLI, and you'll gain insights into how your software is used such as: Install counts Exit codes when your program is invoked Execution times Sub-commands and flags that are passed on the command line If your users wish to use your package without reporting usage statistics, they can pay you for it! You can easily create a Scarf-connected Stripe account, set your desired price for your package, and your users can easily pay to use your package without reporting usage statistics. The best part is that you can get all of these features without writing any code! You simply upload your package to Scarf. The end-user will install your package via scarf which installs your program inside a wrapper so that Scarf can capture your package's usage statistics and enforce permission levels. Install Scarf On Debian-based linux systems, there is a dependency on netbase $ sudo apt-get install netbase To get Scarf, simply run: $ curl -L https://scarf.sh/install | bash You'll then need to add ~/.scarf/bin to you PATH Create your Scarf account Head over to https://scarf.sh to register your developer account. Create your first package Once you're registered, you'll want to create your package on the \"New Package\" page of the Scarf website . You'll need a unique package name, and some description of what your package does. Scarf currently supports packages in the form of: A locally built archive with an executable that can be run directly on the target platform. An npm package that you upload to scarf rather than npm itself. Define your package specification You can now add releases to your package that your users can install! A Scarf package release primarily involves writing a small package specification or uploading your npm package directly. Yaml specifications (archive based packages) Standard archive based packages can be described in yaml. name: \"curl-runnings\" author: \"Avi Press\" copyright: \"2019 Avi Press\" license: \"MIT\" version: \"0.11.0\" # For each platform (currently MacOS and Linux_x86_64) you're distributing your release to, include an entry in distributions. distributions: - platform: MacOS # For simple archive installations, set the name of the executable that will be invoked for your package simpleExecutableInstall: \"curl-runnings\" # uri can be a remote or local tar archive uri: \"https://github.com/aviaviavi/curl-runnings/releases/download/0.11.0/curl-runnings-0.11.0-mac.tar.gz\" # [Optional] if your archive has extra files that should be included, list them here includes: - \"./directories\" - \"./or-files.txt\" - platform: Linux_x86_64 simpleExecutableInstall: \"curl-runnings\" uri: \"./path/to/local/archive.tar.gz\" includes: [] depends: - scarf-packages - your-package - depends-on Some notes: simpleExecutableInstall is currently the only install type supported, but more will be coming soon. You can use scarf check-package ./path/to/your/package-file.yaml to validate your package file. Currently, it won't do things like check your archive or test your release, but it will make sure you spec type-checks, and that you have a valid license type and platform. Dependency handling is still immature. Currently any dependencies you add in your scarf.yaml will use the latest validated version. Npm You can upload an npm based package to scarf rather than npm itself. It will be globally installed by scarf just like any other scarf package. You'll need to make sure your package.json includes a main entry that points to the script that will be ultimately invoked, and the package must have a license. You can use `scarf check-package ./path/to/your/package.json to validate your package file. Upload your release Once you have a valid spec, it's time to upload! You'll need your SCARF_API_TOKEN , which you can find by going to your account page . To upload, run: SCARF_API_TOKEN=${your_token} scarf upload ./path/to/your/validated-spec.(yaml|json) Packages on Scarf can't be deleted once they're uploaded! Once your release is uploaded, your users can install your package with a simple: scarf install ${your_package_name} View your package analytics Once you've pushed a release to your package, you can head over to the dashboard to see your packages install and usage stats! Connect a Stripe Account Navigate to your account details page by clicking your username in the nav bar. Find the Connect to Stripe button at the bottom, and follow Stripe's onboarding process. It only takes a few minutes. You'll be redirected back to Scarf when the enrollment is complete. Add a private usage tier to your package Now that you've connected a Stripe account, you're ready to start collecting payments for your package! Navigate to your package detail page on Scarf and click Start monetizing <package> . Set your price. That's it! Scarf handles all user registration and payments so you are now fully ready to start making money from your package. Stripe will send your payouts daily to your connected bank account. (NOTE: your very first payout will go through 7 days after your account is opened, so be patiend for your first payout.)
